Install HTTP CGI
----------------

Nginx + slowcgi example:

	location /idiotbox/css/.* {
		root /home/www/domains/www.codemadness.org/htdocs/idiotbox/css;
	}

	location ~ ^/idiotbox(/|/\?.*)$ {
		include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
		fastcgi_pass  unix:/run/slowcgi.sock;
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME  /cgi-bin/idiotbox;
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_NAME  /cgi-bin/idiotbox;
		fastcgi_param REQUEST_URI  /cgi-bin/idiotbox;
        }

httpd + slowcgi example:

	location match "/idiotbox" {
		root "/cgi-bin/idiotbox.cgi"
		fastcgi
	}


When using a chroot make sure to copy /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/ssl/cert.pem.

To test from the command-line you can do:

	QUERY_STRING="q=funny+cat+video" ./main | sed 1,2d | lynx -stdin
