- search in channel "empty" string with sort by date doesn't show all newest
  (compared to Atom feed).

- gph: encode search parameter (spaces).
- gph: escape text like "|", TAB and other control-characters.

- youtube_search: make page an int.
- youtube_search: make order some enum type.

- decodeparam, getparam etc: cast ctype functions to (unsigned char).

- order by views does not work in searching channel.
- pagination does not work in searching in channel.
- searching in channel works, but not search in user.

? some way to show duration for playlists?
- show published date in a consistent way? ("non-human friendly": YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS TZ)

- separate code parsing and views for frontend.
- frontends:
  - CGI HTTP
  - CGI gopher
  - dmenu / console (TSV output?) (no HTTP client, just parsing).

- test/tweak Accept-Language header.
